🏛️ PostgreSQL Architecture Overview
1. Process Flow (Query Lifecycle)

Client sends SQL query.
Postmaster hands it to a backend process.
Parser check the syntex and builds parse tree.
Validator: Validates table names, column names, etc.
Planner/Optimizer : builds optimal execution plan.
Executor runs the plan.
Results sent back to client.
WAL + Buffer Manager ensure data is safely written.

🏛️ Fast and FlaskAPI

FastAPI - FastAPI supports concurrent requests using async — perfect for high-performance APIs.
          Uses Pydantic to auto-validate and parse request data using Python type hints
          Automatically generates Swagger UI and Redoc at /docs and /redoc
Flask - Flask handles one customer at a time — no async support by default
        Manual data validation (request.get_json() and if-else logic)
        You have to manually write docs or use Flask-RESTful plugins

🔥 What is CUDA?
CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture — it's a parallel computing platform developed by NVIDIA.
👉 It allows you to run your code (especially heavy tasks like ML training) on a GPU instead of a CPU 

Amazon Readshft - Storing and Handaling the Data and can be fetch by BI tools
Advantages - Scalability , Performance, Costing is low , availability . security 

Query Termination

🧩 How to Set Up SNS(simple notification services) for This
Step 1: Create an SNS Topic
Go to AWS SNS Console
Create a topic: query-terminated
Note the ARN (e.g., arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:1234567890:query-terminated)

Step 2: Subscribe to It
Add email addresses of users who should be notified.
They will receive a confirmation email.
Once confirmed, they'll start receiving alerts.

Step 3: Give Lambda Permission
Attach a policy to Lambda allowing it to publish to that topic:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "sns:Publish",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:1234567890:query-terminated"
}

With large NN we can increase the performance with large amount of data 
activation fucntion from sigmoid to relu 

ðŸ”· What is a Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)?
An FNN is a type of neural network where the data flows in one direction â€” from input to output â€” without cycles or loops. That means there are no backward connections or feedback.

good for regression or multi calssicfication data 
--Limitation :
not good for sequential or text data like time series data 

Parameters - w, b
HyperParameter - alpha , hideen layer(L), activation function , hidden units n1...,

ðŸ”¹ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Hyperparameter | High Value â†’ | Low Value â†’ | Tip
Conv Layers | Overfitting | Underfitting | Use 2â€“4 layers
Filter Size | Generalize more, slower | Miss patterns | Use 3x3
Pool Size | Underfitting | Overfitting | Use 2x2
Batch Size | Overfitting | Regularization | Use 32 or 64
Learning Rate | Fast but unstable | Stable but slow | Start with 0.001
Dropout | Underfitting | Overfitting | Use 0.3â€“0.5
Image Size | Better accuracy | Info loss | Use 128x128+ for complex data

ðŸ”¹ What is Downsampling?
Downsampling is the process of reducing the resolution or dimensionality of input data â€” especially in images or time-series.
In the context of CNNs, downsampling helps reduce:
The number of parameters
Computational cost
Risk of overfitting
Spatial size of the feature maps
